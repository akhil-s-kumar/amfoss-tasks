<h1><b>Introspection</b></h1>

<h3><b>Why must we choose you?</b></h3>

<p>I was started coding when I was in 8th standard, Actually everything was started as a faith because, till 8th standard the only thing I can do with computers was playing games, One day my computer teacher tought us about HTML, and she told us we can make amazing websites with html and it is the foundation of the website. So, till then I have a doubt regarding how a website was made after her lecture it gor clarified. So, after that I was eager to know about different different technologies and to do something with that, So, I learned HTML, CSS, Bootstrap for the frontend part, and after getting into 11th CS I learned how to code with Python and how to make web application with Django. So, I can assure that If I'm in amFOSS, I can contribute with fullstack development also the UI part. Still I can contribute many things provided help from seniors to achieve more skills.</p>

<h4>Technologies I know!</h4>
<p>Bootstrap</p>
<p>Django</p>
<p>MySql</p>
<p>AWS</p>
<p>Photoshop</p>

<h3><b>What is your plan for the next 6 months?</b></h3>

<p>So, my intention is to build something usefull for the society, truely speaking, there is no meaning in saying that I can make this and that. Creating something usefull for the society can only understand our position in that technology, from my own experience. So, I want to say that not only for the next 6 months but for the whole life I will keep trying to make something which is usefull for the community. But my next plan for the comming months is to make a platform where kids and people can study coding from scratch in different regional languages.</p>


<h3><b>How would you contribute back to the club?</b></h3>

<p>I will be there any time for any help, for the club as well as for the members and students. I belive knowledge increases by sharing. Basically, I love teaching technologies I know to others and if at all anyone have any doubts on that, I will clarify it. Also I could figure out people who has the potential to learn different technologies and can do something with that.</p>

<h3><b>Do you have any feedback for the selection process?</b></h3>

<p>Actually, I don't have any feedbacks eventhough I can't solve every tasks, because this can make us understand that what we have learnt till now and what we need to learn more.</p>
